# Title: An Adventure Game
## Author
Yu, David
## What I built
A multiple choice adventure game built on websites
## How I did it
I used simple html and css to make webpages, with links that leads to choices and consequences. I also used custom fonts for the letters
## How it works
Clinking on a link(choice) will lead to another web page, with more choices or a consequence. Dying in the game will lead the player back to the start
